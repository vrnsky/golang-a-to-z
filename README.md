# golang-a-to-z
This project is for educational use only. No production-ready code exists in this repository.

### Credits
All projects are from the book Learn Go with Pocket-Sized Projects by
Ali√©nor Latour, Donia Chaiehloudj, and Pascal Bertrand.

### Different versions
The code in this repository can be different from the versions provided by the authors, 
due to my experiments with language. Please do not use this repository as a source of truth.

### Plans for this project and other stuff
This project uses GitHub Actions to ensure the code is at least compilable.
I don't plan to add more workflows, as there is no need.
